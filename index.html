                <h1>Krasnoyarsk</h1>
                <h2>Arrival</h2>
                <p>   Eh! There is something to remember about a trip to Krasnoyarsk. It all started with, that it was June 13 and I had to get ready for bed, but I did not want sleep, on the contrary, I had fun with my sister. And finally it was June 14, day of departure from Kaliningrad (I live there). Father started the car and he took my grandmother and my sister and me to the airport. There we passed the check-in and baggage inspection, we waited until they announced that all passengers need to go and get on the plane and actually got on the plane. We flighted on plane of "Aeroflot" airline. If something, we arrived in Moscow, and then - frome Moscow to Krasnoyarsk. It was 3 o'clock in the morning, I wanted to sleep terribly, So I slept (I woke up just to eat). At six o'clock in the morning(on Moscow time) We flighted to Moscow. Then we wented to the priority pass. If only you knew what 4 hours in a business hall is! This is a pleasure! After that, after sitting in the business lounge, we took a flight to Krasnoyarsk. We flew for more than 4 hours! I fell apart when I was flying! For reference: we flew to Moscow for 2 hours, and to Krasnoyarsk for 4 or even 5 hours. In Krasnoyarsk, we were met by Vera and Nadezhda (as far as I understood, they are friends and colleagues from my grandmother's work). We talked to them and went to Vera's apartment. There I ate dumplings, ate a cake and went to bed. I, like my sister, was very tired, and we could not get used to the Krasnoyarsk time in any way.
                    <h2>Second day</h2>
                    <p>As far as I remember, I woke up early. I cleaned my teeth, washed my face and went to breakfast.On this day we took a walk and visited 3 museums. To the museum of the Krasnoyarsk Railway, to the Surikov Estate Museum and to the local history Museum. In museum of the Krasnoyarsk Railway we were shown the history of the creation of the Krasnoyarsk railway.For more information, you can read <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9A%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%8F%D1%80%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%B6%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%B4%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%B0">here.</a> By the way, it was in this museum that I learned that V. P. Astafyev worked on the railway. I also liked Surikov's estate. Firstly, it is very comfortable for life, and secondly, everything is shown there very interestingly. There you can also see some paintings by Surikov. I advise everyone visit this museum if you also somehow get to Krasnoyarsk! And finally, the Local History Museum. I really liked it there. There you can see a lot of interesting things related to Krasnoyarsk. Will you be in Krasnoyarsk , necessarily visit this museum! After the museums, we walked along the Yenisei. To be honest, the Yenisei is a wide and mighty river! Then we buy ice cream in kiosk and we started eating it. After eating ice cream, we went home to Vera.</p>
                    <h2>Third day</h2>
                    <p>I'm get up at eight o'clock, this is found out before everyone else and I went wash my face,clean my teeth and went to breakfast. And for breakfast we had pancakes.At 10 o'clock in the morning we had an excursion to Divnogorsk and to Ovsyanka. We were driving by car, and Nadezhda (the guide) gave us a tour. She told us about the foundation of Krasnoyarsk, about Astafyev and about the history of his life, about Ovsyanka (the village where Viktor Astafyev lived). We also looked at Divnogorsk from the observation deck "Tsar-fish". The beauty, of course, is indescribable! Coniferous trees grow everywhere, which seem to reach the sky. Then we went to Ovsyanka where Nadezhda told us about the life of Astafyev, and after the Ovsyanka, we went to the Krasnoyarsk hydroelectric power station. We were lucky! We got there when there was a discharge of water from the hydroelectric dam. I also learned about the man-made disaster at the Shushenskaya GES. The catastrophe, of course, is terrible, and you can not argue with this. After the hydroelectric power plant, we went home. I really liked the tour. And Nadezhda explains it so interestingly, leads the tour so interestingly, that I immediately realized that the person is passionate. After we had lunch at home and rested, we wented walking along the Yaryginskaya embankment. The embankment there was flooded! A terrible thing! After the walk, we returned home, had dinner, and after dinner we were getting ready for bed.</p>
                <h2>Fourth day</h2>
                <p>On this day, I woke up at 8 o'clock in the morning. I brushed my teeth, washed my face, and had a hearty breakfast. Forecasters literally told us a terrible story. They caused us to rain with a thunderstorm, but, hooray,it was not. And it's good that we didn't believe the weather forecasters and went to the Nikolaevskaya Sopka. It was difficult to climb the hill, but we managed(although it was hot that day). The views from the Nikolaevsky Hill were simply magnificent! Around the city, along the Yenisei. And we were also lucky that we got to the release of Prima TV (local television, the project "100 golden places of Krasnoyarsk"). You can watch the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn3nV7k3GiY">here.</a> We sat there, looked at the beautiful views and moved on to the Gremyachaya Mane ecopark.It was just wonderful in this ecopark! This is a great place for walking, there is even an open-air geological museum there! I advise everyone to visit the ecopark and Nikolaevskaya Gorka. After the walk, we went home, had dinner and gradually got ready for bed.</p>
                <h2>Fifth day</h2>
                <p>This day was special! Because we were going to the dacha to Nadezhda (not to the guide). At 10.30pm we took the train to the desired station. You can read more in the blog <a href="https://petrwasimposter.github.io/bookish-bassoon/">"summer at the Krasnoyarsk dacha".</a></p>
                <h2>Eighth day</h2>
                <p>We were at the dacha for 3 days, after the dacha, we went to the city. And we went for a reason, we had an excursion to the Pillars (reserve). Nadezhda was our guide again. Nadezhda told us about the stolbists, about the history of the Pillars, about Elena Krutovskaya, and in general everything related to the Pillars. We walked there for 5 hours. On the way back, we bought souvenirs (badges and a book by Elena Krutovskaya "Dixie"). After the walk, we went home, there we ate, rested, and after a rest at 10 o'clock in the evening went to bed.</p>
                <h2>Ninth day</h2>
                <p>On this day, I woke up safely. I brushed my teeth, washed my face,had breakfast, and we went to see the technical school where my grandmother worked. On this day, I met Valery and Lena (they are also colleagues of my grandmother). We visited the technical school and the hostel. Then we went for a walk in the "Gardens of Dreams". We took a walk and went to the apartment of Nadezhda (a colleague), to visit. The next day we went to the Assumption Monastery. There we looked at the creativity of children, took a walk along the embankment of the Yenisei. After the walk, we went home and had a farewell dinner at home, because the next day we were flying to Kaliningrad. To be honest, I didn't want to go back, because I was just used to the time difference, I was generally used to life in Krasnoyarsk.</p>
                <h2>The tenth day(departure)</h2>
                <p>We ordered a taxi to the airport, did not register anymore, because we had already registered through the Aeroflot app and were waiting for the flight. We got on a plane and flew to Moscow for 5 hours. We arrived in Moscow, sat in a Priority pass for 4 hours and flew to Kaliningrad. When we arrived, we received our luggage, and our mother met us at the exit, and after that our father drove us home. This is the end of our trip to Krasnoyarsk.</p>
